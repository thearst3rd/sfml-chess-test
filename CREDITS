TODO - make these good, actual credits
       I'm not trying to steal stuff I swear!!!
       Also TODO, make the actual sounds myself (and maybe even images)


--- Sounds ---

The following sound I got from https://github.com/ornicar/lila/tree/master/public/sound/standard.
I do not actually believe I am able to use this for real when I release this. For more information, see:
	https://github.com/ornicar/lila/blob/master/COPYING.md
I hope that it is alright that I am using it as a placeholder for now.

terminal.wav <-- GenericNotify.ogg


The next sound, I got from freesound.org.

check.wav    <-- https://freesound.org/people/Joao_Janz/sounds/478502/


The other two sounds, I actually recorded myself!

move.wav
capture.wav
