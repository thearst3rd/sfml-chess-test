## Sounds

I downloaded the following sounds from freesound.org:

Filename | File on freesound | Author | License | Notes
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
check.wav | ["Notification 1_1"](https://freesound.org/people/Joao_Janz/sounds/478502/) | [Joao_Janz](https://freesound.org/people/Joao_Janz/) | [CC BY-NC 3.0] |
terminal.wav | ["Chord Alert Notification"](https://freesound.org/people/graham_makes/sounds/457518/) | [graham_makes](https://freesound.org/people/graham_makes/) | [CC BY 3.0] | In order for the sound to work properly in my program, I had to open it import it into Audacity and re-export it. The .wav file found in this repository is not the original file.

The other two sounds, I actually recorded myself! Feel free to use them, though if you have a chessboard and a microphone you might be able to do better yourself :)
